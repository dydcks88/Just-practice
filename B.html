        <h5>2. Book</h5>
        A book is both a usually portable physical object and the body of immaterial representations or intellectual object whose material signs written or drawn lines or other two-dimensional media—the physical object contains or houses.
        As a physical object, a book is a stack of usually rectangular pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) oriented with one longer side (either left or right, depending on the direction in which one reads a script) tied, sewn, or otherwise fixed together and then bound to the flexible spine of a protective cover of heavier, relatively inflexible material so that, when the opened front cover has received a massy enough stack of sheets, the book can lie flat.[1] The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (in the plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the scroll.          <img src="success.jpg" width="100%">
